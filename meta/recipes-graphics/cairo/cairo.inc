SUMMARY = "The Cairo 2D vector graphics library"
DESCRIPTION = "Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased \
vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist \
of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width \
with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with \
optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the \
extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render \
Extension."
