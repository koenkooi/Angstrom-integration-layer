You had no conf/local.conf file. Poky has created this configuration file for
you with some default values. You may wish to edit it to use a different MACHINE
(target hardware) or enable parallel build options to take advantage of multiple
cores for example. See the file for more information as common configuration
options are commented.

Also, for more information see the Poky Reference Manual:

### Shell environment set up for Poky builds. ###

You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

Common targets are:
    poky-image-minimal
    poky-image-sato
    meta-toolchain
    meta-toolchain-sdk

You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
