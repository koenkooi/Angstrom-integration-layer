Disable the LDFLAGS "-Bsymbolic-functions" for mips

"-Bsymbolic-functions" flag makes ld to bind the global function symbol of shared library at compiling time, thus reduce the runtime relocation cost.

However, this flag in binutil 2.20 cause QT4 mips building failure, which is "final link failed: Bad value" error in libQtWebKit.so linking stage. If downgrad to binutil 2.19, this error disappears. further investigation showes commit http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/src/ld/scripttempl/mips.sc.diff?r1=1.2&r2=1.3&cvsroot=src cause this error.

So this patch disable this flag for QT4 mips. If future binutils version fix this issue, this patch can be safely removed.
